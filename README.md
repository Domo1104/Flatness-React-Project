# Flatness-React-Project

This is a project designed by Renae Carter, Chris Ou, and Caleb Summeralls. The project is a take on a fitness app which is a one stop shop for keeping a record on different cardio based exercises. You can track your cardio excercises from walking, running, swimming, rollerblading, and biking. Keep track of the distance, time, and calories burned to make sure you're getting the most out of your workout.

First tab you see is the Home section that has a description on what the app is about. Second tab is the About Us with a little something about all the integral members that made this app possible. Third tab is where the good stuff is. The List of Workouts tab where you can keep track of previous workouts and enter new workouts. You are able to favorite your workouts for various reasons be it a very long biking session, personal best time, or even if the scenary was nice that day. It's all up to you! It is also sorted by newest to oldest dates. A delete button to get rid of some old times.

### New update in the works...

Implementing a gps tracker so you don't need to enter info.
